## Course Data

Here are downloadable archives of the data used on AWS throughout the course. They can be uncompressed with:

`tar -vxzf Module0.tar.gz` (change 0 to the number of the module)

* `tar`: tool for archiving and compressing files
* `-v`: verbally (print out the list of files as they are decompressed)
* `-x`: extract (decompress)
* `-z`: gzip (compression format)
* `-f`: file (name of file to be decompressed)

After decompressing you will have a directory for each module. Note that some of the modules will have extra files that we didn't use, like files used to create the easy-to-navigate labs for module 11.
